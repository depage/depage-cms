Project Settings
================

The settings pages let you adjust and change project settings.

*Usually this is the responsibility of the administrators*


Navigation
----------

Navigation properties help to structure a project or to change specific settings in a template.

Common navigation properties include:

- hidden: A page will be generated, but will be hidden from the navigation
- no english: English version of the page will not be displayed
- no german: German version of the page will not be displayed
- news: page or folder contains pages that will be included in the atom feed

*Usually this is the responsibility of the administrators, because the functionality largely depends on the templates.*


Tags
----

*Tags* help you to categorize and filter your pages. But the templates of the project have to support this functionality. You may reorder tags per drag and drop.


Languages
--------

depage-cms enables you to generate a page in multiple languages. Different language version always work in tandem, meaning depage-cms always generates a page in all languages in the same page structure.

The first languages doubles as fallback language if the users browser does not support one of the current translations.
